# Twitter-Data-Analysis

This week's challenge is to analyze data from Twitter to extract any insightful information. The main objective is to understand and/or have a view on the opinions of Internet users regarding economic difficulties.</br>
The data were collected from Twitter API using the keywords [‘inflation’, ‘fuelprice’, ‘fuelpricehike’, ‘ fuelprices’, ‘fuelshortage’, ‘foodprice’, ‘oilprice’, ‘oilprices’, ‘cookingoilprice’, ‘unemployment’, ‘unemploymentrate’, ‘economiccrisis’, ‘economichardship’]. From the data set, some descriptive statistics will be computed: the most used hashtag, the period when people are complaining the most of economic difficulties and why not, the tweets that get the highest number of engagement.
