# Twitter-Data-Analysis
## Task 1
### 10 Accademy intensive challenge week 
#### Basics of Git hub, fixing bugs, unittest & Travis CI

##### What I did
`1.` I Forked a repository from https://github.com/10xac/Twitter-Data-Analysis to my github account

`2.` I Created a branch called “fix_bug” then I fixed the bugs in the fix_clean_tweets_dataframe.py and fix_extract_dataframe.py & renamed the files removing 'fix'

`3.` I pushed the code everytime I changed, and once the fix is done, I merged the `fix_bug` branch to main.

`4.` I created a new branch called `make_unittest` for creating a new unit test for extract_dataframe.py code, and while completing the unit test writing, I merged the  “make_unittest”  to main branch

`5.` I logged in to the Travis CI using my Git hub account and set it up to my repository. 

`6.` All the tests have passed successfully.
